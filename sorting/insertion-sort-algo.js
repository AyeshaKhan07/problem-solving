/**
 * As the name suggests, in this sorting algorithm, we take the element and insert it into 
 * its correct position. We start with the first element, thatâ€™s considered sorted of course.
 * Then we move to the second element and compare it with the first element. We swap it if 
 * the second element is lesser than the first one else we move to the third element. The 
 * third element is then compared with the first and second element, and will get swapped 
 * to its correct position.
